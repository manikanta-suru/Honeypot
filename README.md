Honeypots: Brief introduction 
Honeypots are a type of Internet security resource that is used to entice cybercriminals to deceive them when they try to intrude inside the network for any illegal use. These honeypots are generally set up to understand the activity of the attacker in the network so that the organization can come up with stronger prevention methods against these intrusions. The honeypots do not carry any valuable data, as they are a fake proxy that helps in logging the network traffic.
